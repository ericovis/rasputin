# Progress log (append-only)

- 2026-08-28 · plan · Plan created. Preflight survey done over SSH (results
  in FACTS.md): all nodes aarch64/Trixie//boot/firmware/32GB; live MAC↔name
  mapping recorded (differs from an earlier owner-pasted order — live state
  adopted); 003 offline; 002/004 lack passwordless sudo (see BLOCKERS).
  Legacy shell prototype (validated: static aarch64 busybox+zstd initramfs,
  crafted /dev/console cpio entry, init script signed off) moved to legacy/
  as the behavioral reference for the Go agent.
